# Progress Log: Version 3.0

This file tracks the development progress for Version 3.0 of the image conversion utility, focusing on UI/UX enhancements.

## ‚úÖ Stage 1: Theme Selection (Light/Dark Mode)

- [x] Install the `ttkthemes` library and add it to `requirements.txt`.
- [x] Add a "Theme" option (e.g., a dropdown or toggle) to the "Settings" tab.
- [x] Implement the logic to switch the application's theme dynamically.
- [x] Update the `save_settings` and `load_settings` functions to handle the new theme preference in `config.json`.

## ‚úÖ Stage 2: Drag and Drop Support

- [x] Install a suitable drag-and-drop library (e.g., `tkinterdnd2`) and add it to `requirements.txt`.
- [x] Integrate the library with the main application window.
- [x] Implement the logic to accept a dropped folder on the "Converter" tab and set it as the source directory.
- [x] Provide visual feedback when a user is dragging a folder over the window.

## ‚úÖ Stage 3: Live Preview

- [x] Add a new "Preview" tab to the notebook.
- [x] Implement logic to load the first image from the selected source folder.
- [x] Display a "before" thumbnail of the original image.
- [x] Display an "after" thumbnail that updates in real-time when settings (dimensions, format) are changed.
- [x] Handle cases where no folder is selected or the folder contains no images.

### **Implementation Status**

#### **Phase 0: Pre-Implementation Setup** ‚è≥
- [ ] Validate development environment and dependencies
- [ ] Test rembg library compatibility with existing codebase
- [ ] Pre-download AI models using download_models.py script
- [ ] Create feature branch and backup current code

#### **Phase 1: Core Integration** 
- [ ] Add background removal UI components to Settings tab
- [ ] Implement settings persistence for remove_bg option
- [ ] Add state management for PNG-only feature activation
- [ ] Create basic session management infrastructure

#### **Phase 2: Background Removal Logic**
- [ ] Implement thread-safe rembg session management
- [ ] Integrate background removal into preview pipeline
- [ ] Add background removal to batch conversion process
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling

#### **Phase 3: Production Features**
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and warnings
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for failures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create cleanup and resource management

#### **Phase 4: Build Preparation**
- [ ] Update PyInstaller spec with model files and dependencies
- [ ] Test build process and validate executable functionality
- [ ] Verify offline functionality and model bundling
- [ ] Optimize build size and validate performance

#### **Phase 5: Testing & Validation**
- [ ] Comprehensive functional testing across scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with various image sizes
- [ ] Error scenario testing and recovery validation
- [ ] Cross-machine compatibility verification

### **Quality Gates**
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Review**: Senior engineer review completed
- ‚è≥ **Environment Validation**: Dependencies and compatibility check
- ‚è≥ **Core Functionality**: Basic feature working end-to-end
- ‚è≥ **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery implemented
- ‚è≥ **Build Validation**: Packaged executable fully functional
- ‚è≥ **Performance Validation**: Acceptable speed and memory usage

### **Technical Implementation Notes**
- **Model Choice**: Using `u2net` as default (good balance of quality/size)
- **Threading**: Background removal in separate thread to maintain UI responsiveness
- **Memory**: Session reuse reduces model loading overhead, monitoring prevents exhaustion
- **Compatibility**: CPU-only version for maximum compatibility across systems
- **Fallback**: Application remains functional if rembg fails or is unavailable
- **Build Impact**: Executable size will increase ~200MB due to model inclusion

### **Risk Mitigation Status**
- üü¢ **Low Risk**: Basic integration and UI components
- üü° **Medium Risk**: Memory management and threading coordination  
- üî¥ **High Risk**: PyInstaller compatibility and model bundling
- ‚ö´ **Critical**: Production error handling and graceful degradation

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 11-15 hours across 5 phases
**Target Completion**: Implementation ready pending project prioritization

## ‚úÖ Stage 4: Finalization

- [x] Test all new UI/UX features thoroughly.
- [x] Update the version number to "3.0".
- [x] Update the `README.md` and other documentation to reflect the new features.
- [x] Build the new v3.0 executable using PyInstaller.
