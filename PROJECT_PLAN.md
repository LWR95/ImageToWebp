# Project Plan: Image to WebP Converter

This document outlines the plan for creating a simple utility to convert images to the WebP format.

## 1. Project Goal

To create a user-friendly desktop tool that batch-converts images from a selected folder to WebP format, with specific resizing and padding rules.

## 2. Core Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The tool will have a simple window for all interactions.
- **Source Folder Selection**: A button to allow the user to select a folder containing the images they want to convert.
- **Destination Folder Selection**: A button to allow the user to choose where the converted WebP files will be saved.
- **Quality Control**: A slider (ranging from 1 to 100) to control the quality of the output WebP images.
- **Start Conversion**: A "Convert" button to begin the batch processing.

## 3. UI and User Experience

The application window will be designed for simplicity and clarity, guiding the user through the conversion process step-by-step.

- **Layout**: A single, non-resizable window organized vertically.
  - **Source Selection**: A label, a non-editable text box for the path, and a `Browse...` button.
  - **Destination Selection**: A label, a non-editable text box for the path, and a `Browse...` button.
  - **Quality Setting**: A label and a horizontal slider (defaulting to 85).
- **User Flow**:
  - The `Convert Images` button will remain disabled until both a source and a destination folder are selected.
  - A status bar at the bottom will provide real-time feedback (e.g., "Ready", "Converting...", "Conversion Complete!").

## 4. Image Processing Logic

For each image processed, the tool will perform the following steps:

1.  **Handle Transparency**: Before processing, the tool will check if an image has a transparency channel (e.g., in a PNG). If it does, the image will be flattened onto a solid white background to prevent black backgrounds in the output.
2.  **Resize to Fit**: The image will be resized to fit within a 500x500 pixel boundary while maintaining its original aspect ratio.
3.  **Pad with White Background**: A new 500x500 pixel canvas with a white background will be created.
4.  **Center the Image**: The resized image will be pasted onto the center of the white canvas.
5.  **Convert to WebP**: The final 500x500 image will be saved in the WebP format in the user-specified destination folder.

## 5. Application Robustness

To ensure a smooth and reliable user experience, the following measures will be implemented:

- **Error Handling**:
  - The application will gracefully skip non-image files or corrupted images.
  - A user-friendly pop-up message will be displayed for critical errors (e.g., no write permissions).
  - The status bar will log the number of successfully converted and skipped files.
- **UI Responsiveness**:
  - The core conversion logic will run in a separate thread to prevent the GUI from freezing, especially when processing a large number of images.

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **GUI Library**: `tkinter`
- **Image Processing Library**: `Pillow`
- **Threading**: Python's built-in `threading` module.

## 7. File Structure

- `image_converter.py`: The main Python script containing the application code.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing project dependencies (e.g., `Pillow`, `PyInstaller`).
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`: This file.
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md`: A file to track development progress.
- `DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md`: Document listing project dependencies and system environment.

## 8. Deployment

After the script has been thoroughly tested and finalized, it will be packaged into a standalone executable (`.exe`) using PyInstaller. A `requirements.txt` file will be used to ensure a consistent and repeatable build process. This will allow the tool to be run on other Windows machines without requiring a Python installation.
