# Progress Log: Image to WebP Converter

This file tracks the development progress of the image conversion utility.

## ✅ Stage 1: Planning and Design (August 7, 2025)

- [X] Brainstormed core features and user interaction flow.
- [X] Defined image processing logic (resize, pad, convert).
- [X] Selected technology stack (Python, Tkinter, Pillow).
- [X] Created `PROJECT_PLAN.md` to document the project scope.
- [X] Created this `PROGRESS_LOG.md` file.

## ⬜️ Stage 2: Setup and Dependencies

- [ ] Install the `Pillow` library.
- [ ] Create the main application file (`image_converter.py`).
- [ ] Set up the basic GUI window structure.

## ⬜️ Stage 3: Core Feature Implementation

- [ ] Implement source folder selection logic.
- [ ] Implement destination folder selection logic.
- [ ] Add the quality control slider to the GUI.
- [X] Implement the image processing and conversion logic.
- [X] Add logic to handle transparent images by flattening them onto a white background.
- [X] Connect the "Convert" button to the processing logic.

## ⬜️ Stage 4: Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Test the application with various image types (PNG, JPG, etc.).
- [ ] Test with different folder structures.
- [ ] Ensure the quality slider works as expected.
- [ ] Refine the user interface and add status messages (e.g., "Conversion complete").

## ⬜️ Stage 5: Finalization

- [ ] Add comments and clean up the code.
- [ ] Create a `README.md` with instructions on how to run the tool.
