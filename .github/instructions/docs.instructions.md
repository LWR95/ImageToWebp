Docs rules
- Keep version numbers consistent with `ImageConverterApp.version` in `image_converter.py` and release artifacts.
- User Guide: reflect that enabling AI forces PNG output and disables quality; note startup 15â€“25s for single-file EXE; include supported formats.
- Avoid committing build artifacts paths in docs; reference the spec used (`SHH_Image_Converter_v4_SingleFile.spec`).
